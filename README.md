# ${1:MusicSort}

MusicSort is based on audio recognition to obtain basic information of each song. This way, using another sources, i.e. APIs,
the service obtains metadata and completes the fields of the song. On the other hand, music is registered and organized in different folders according to the classification selection: artist, album, year, etc. Thus, the application returns the input music completed with all the metadata and classified according to the criteria selected.
